      <h2>Project Info</h2>
    
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates a settings panel with toggle functionality alongside a glass morphism info card design. 
        It's a modern approach to creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Glass Morphism Design</h3>
      <p>
        Glass morphism is a design trend characterized by blurred backgrounds, transparency, and a frosted glass effect. It creates a sense of depth and elegance, making the UI feel immersive and contemporary. In this project, you can interact with different UI elements that showcase this design technique.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
      <p>
        The settings panel allows you to toggle various elements, adjusting their visibility or behavior. These toggles represent common settings options in many modern web applications, helping you understand how these controls work while also enhancing the look and feel of the interface.
      </p>
    
      <h3>UI/UX Learning</h3>
      <p>
        This project is not only an exploration of glass morphism but also an excellent learning tool for UI/UX design. By interacting with the settings panel and observing the effects, you'll get insights into how modern web design principles are applied in practice. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project can help you level up your design skills.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Customization</h3>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore and customize the visibility of various UI elements! You can experiment with toggles to hide or show different components, giving you the flexibility to control how the UI behaves. 
        This customization enhances the interactivity of the interface, making it more engaging and personalized.
